Tourism depends largely on a high water consumption. Previous studies have primarily focused on virtual water
embodied in goods or products through trade. Our study provides novel insights into the virtual water embodied
in goods and services purchased by tourists. We identified the tourism blue water footprint (TWF) of China
according to the environmentally extended input–output table of 135 sectors (11 direct +124 indirect tourism
sectors) together with tourism satellite account data. The results show that the agriculture, electricity, and petroleum
sectors majorly contribute to the indirect TWF, while the accommodation and air transport sectors
majorly contribute to the direct TWF and were water intensive. Using a constant ratio of 1.5 relating local water
footprints to tourist water footprints, we then estimate that China’s outbound tourists consume more water than
inbound tourists (net TWF of 906 million m3). Nearly half of the net TWF from Chinese tourists is consumed in
water deficient countries. Thus, the pressure caused by Chinese tourists on global water resources should be
considered. This paper quantitatively evaluates the impact of China’s tourism-induced water transfer on global
water resources from the perspective of direct and indirect tourism consumption. The results of this paper enrich
the research cases of the impact of final consumption on water resources utilization.
1. Introduction
Global tourism income contributes to 10.4% of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2019 and is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 4%,
thus outpacing many other economic sectors (Statista, 2020; Lenzen
et al., 2018). In China, the number of domestic tourists increased from
2,100 to 5,500 million with annual growth rate of 18% and the domestic
tourism income increased from 180 to 730 billion US $ with annual
growth rate of 34% from 2010 to 2018. Additionally, the number of
inbound tourists increased from 130 to 140 million with annual growth
rate of 1%, the inbound tourism income increased from 40 to 120 billion
US $ with annual growth rate of 20%. Moreover, the number of
outbound tourists rank highest in the world and for the first time
outbound tourists exceeded the inbound tourists in China. The number
of outbound tourists increased from 5 million to 143 million with an
average annual growth rate of 17% (NBSC, 2020). It is estimated that the
output value of China’s outbound tourism reached 670 billion US $ in
2016, which accounted for 21% of the world’s international tourism
spending (PIE, 2019). In addition, China has a long history and many
historic sites to become a famous worldwide tourism destination.
Millions of international and domestic tourists are attracted to China to
experience various tourism activities. The tourism industry contributed
11% to the GDP for China in 2018 (WB, 2019).
However, the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late December
2019, has lead to the world facing an unprecedented global health, social
and economic emergency. It has drastically disturbed global value
chains and impeded economic growth, including severe restrictions on
movement (Dong et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020). Tourism is the most
affected industry as a result of travel restrictions and city lockdown
(Lenzen et al., 2020; UNWTO, 2020). In addition to hazards for human
health, it is forecast that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in a loss of
300–450 billion US$ in international tourism receipts (UNWTO, 2020).
China Tourism Academy shows that in the first half of 2020, the number
of domestic tourists was 1,168 million with -62% growth rate and the
domestic tourism revenue was 97 billion US$ with -77% growth rate
(CTA, 2020). The epidemic of COVID-19 has profoundly impacted the
industry structure and consumption pattern in China’s tourism.
Water is one of the most crucial resources for supporting the massive
and rapidly growing tourism industry. However, the rapidly growing
water consumption may increase scarcity of water and environmental

issues, which have been investigated in previous studies (Berger et al.,
2012; Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2007; Chen and Chen, 2013; Chen et al.,
2012; Jeswani and Azapagic, 2011; Stoessel et al., 2012). The term
“water footprint” (WF) is an index of the humans’ use of freshwater
resources and has three components: blue, green, and gray (Hoekstra
et al., 2011), referring to the consumption of blue water resources (e.g.,
surface and ground water), the green water (i.e., rainwater), and the
grey water (i.e. the consumption of freshwater required to assimilate the
load of pollutants based on existing standards for ambient water quality),
respectively (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012). In this context,
consumption refers to the volume of water that evaporates or is incorporated
into a product.
The WF also represents an indicator not only for direct water use of a
product or service but also for the indirect use of water. Direct water use
refers to the water consumption during the production of a product or
service. Indirect water use refers to the water consumption in the supply
chains of products and services. The WF is measured over the entire
supply chain for the volume of water consumed during the
manufacturing process of the product or the provision of a service
(Hoekstra, 2009). The WF can be applied to a single service, such as the
washing of clothes, or to a product, such as a computer and could be
used to measure the water volume used for a particular country or a
multi-national enterprise (Hoekstra et al., 2011). The WF provides a
picture of the use of water for various human activities geographically
and temporally. It is useful to evaluate the sustainable use and allocation
of water resources (Ercin et al., 2011).
There are two common approaches to assess tourism water footprint
(TWF): top-down and bottom-up approaches (Wang et al., 2017). The
bottom-up approach utilizes the life cycle assessment (LCA) principle
and can be used to assess the WF of tourism-related products or services
stepwise (De Alvarenga et al., 2012; Dwyer et al., 2010). However, the
LCA applied in the bottom-up approach is limited by unavailable information
for parts of the supply chain of tourism related sectors and,
consequently, the accuracy of the results is questionable (Kuo and Chen,
2009; Zhou et al., 2015). The bottom-up approach is usually applied to
calculate the WF for settled tourism facilities, such as hotels and parks.
Typical top-down approaches employ the input–output (IO) analysis
principle focused predominantly on the virtual water embodied in goods
or products through trade, usually at national or global scale (Mekonnen
and Hoekstra, 2010; Steen-Olsen et al., 2012) due to the trade of goods
or products is fixed and easier be documented, while tourism activities
are rather flexible and dynamic. IO analysis typically uses official data
rather than direct measurement, for example, official data published by
China government used by many researchers (Meng et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2020). These data are considered to be authoritative and accurate.
Moreover, since the environmentally extended input–output (EEIO) and
tourism satellite account (TSA) data are available to the public, for TWF
analysis, there have been a number of previous analyses using the
top-down approach to assess the TWF of an entire country or the world
(Cadarso et al., 2015; Cazcarro et al., 2016; Hadjikakou et al., 2015; Sun
and Hsu, 2019). For example, Taiwan’s TWF has been investigated using
EEIO and TSA methods (Sun and Hsu, 2019).
For TWF, direct tourism water use originates from tourists themselves
during tourism activities, such as transportation, food consumption,
drinking, shopping, accommodation, and entertainment (Bennasar,
2014). Indirect tourism water use refers to the other water consumption
that supports tourism activities, such as power, energy, fuel, and raw
material related sectors, including agriculture (Cazcarro et al., 2014).
The water consumption per tourist is around two to three times higher
than that of the local residents in developed countries and even more in
developing countries (G¨ ossling et al., 2012). G¨ ossling et al. also examined
the global TWF by reviewing more than 120 papers in terms of
accommodation, activities, infrastructure, fuel use, and the food sector.
Many previous studies related to TWF focused on a certain region or
sector for an in-depth analysis (Li, 2018; Sun and Hsu, 2019; Zhang
et al., 2017). For example, the TWF of the Huangshan mountain in China
Journal of Hydrology 603 (2021) 127151
has been investigated in terms of food, accommodation, transportation,
management, and sewage (Zhang et al., 2017). However, most existing
studies did not attempt to quantify the water footprint for whole tourism
industry including its supply chain in China. This study combines the
EEIO and TSA data to calculate the TWF of China accounting for 135
sectors. In addition, the influence of the Chinese tourists’ TWF on the
rest of the world and the influence of the global tourists’ TWF on China
are compared in this study. Our findings can help government to evaluate
the impact of tourism industry on water resources, and provides
unique insights into the virtual water flows embodied in people via
tourism.
2. Research data and methods
2.1. Data sources
2.1.1. Tourism satellite account (TSA) data
To understand the activities and contributions of tourism, the World
Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has requested each country’s national
tourism administration and national statistical office to provide an
official TSA. The TSA is a useful tourism database that contains economic
statistical data related to the activities of tourists and the industries
supplying the acquired goods and services for tourism. China’s
2017 TSA reports are provided by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of
the People’s Republic of China (CTS, 2018). It includes number of
tourists, tourism visiting days of domestic and inbound tourists, and
expenditure of 12 direct tourism sectors. The direct tourism sectors in
this paper referred the prevailing activities for tourism such as transportation,
accommodation, food and entertainment.
2.1.2. Input-output (IO) table
The China 2017 IO table with 135-sectors from National Bureau of
Statistics of China were adopted in this study (NBSC, 2020).
2.1.3. Water use data of 135 sectors
The water use of agriculture sector is derived from the 2017 agricultural
water use data issued by the China Statistical Yearbook of 2018
(CSY, 2018). Moreover, the water use of industrial sectors is derived
from the 2017 industrial water use data issued by the China Statistical
Yearbook of 2018 (CSY, 2018).
2.2. Method
2.2.1. Combining the IO table and water use data into an EEIO table
Monetary input–output (IO) tables give insight into the value of
economic transactions between different sectors in an economy. Such
monetary IO tables can be ‘extended’ with environment-related information
for each sector, such as its emissions, natural resource use, land
use and other external effects for each sector and integrated into Environmentally
Extended Input-Output (EEIO) tables. EEIO tables provide
an authoritative model supporting information-based environmental
and economic policies (Tukker et al., 2006). In our paper, based on 2017
IO table and water use data of 135 sectors from National Bureau of
Statistics of China (NBSC, 2020) are integrated into EEIO table.
2.2.2. Integrating the TSA data and EEIO table
A top-down approach was adopted to assess China’s TWF of domestic
and inbound tourists by using the EEIO table and tourism data obtained
from the TSA. To construct a water-based EEIO model for tourism services,
the parameters of visitor expenditure data, the national IO table,
and water use coefficients are composed. The structure of the combination
of TSA and EEIO table used in this study is shown in Table 1.
The fundamental matrix balance equation for the IO table, which
reveals the connection between the total output and final demand, is
given below (Leontief, 1970):

where X is the column vector of the total output, Y is a column vector of
the final demand, and Ai,j is the direct consumption coefficient matrix
describing consumption of the sector in row i per unit of output of the
sector in column j, i.e. in the following form:
⋮ ⋱ ⋮
A=⎛ ⎝A1,1⋯ A1,135
A135,1⋯ A135,135
⎞ ⎠ (2)
Equation (1) can then be rewritten as
X= (I-A)-1 Y (3)
where I is the identity matrix and has the same order as matrix A. (I-A)-1
is the Leontief inverse square matrix of 135 sectors IO table.
Owing to data limitations and accounting boundaries, this study only
considers blue WF as TWF derived from tourism activities. The direct
water use coefficient of each sector (Dwci) is calculated as follows:
Dwci =
Wi
Xi
(4)
where Wi is the water use (m3) of sector i, and Xi is the economic total
output (US$) of sector i of IO table. Water use needs to be divided across
sectors. The water use of agricultural sector is derived from the 2017
agricultural water use data issued by the China Statistical Yearbook of
2018 (CSY, 2018). The water use of industrial sectors are derived by the
National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC, 2019) which cover 52
industrial sectors. The distribution of the water use of the remaining
sectors is calculated according to the ratio of the water supply sector’s
complete consumption coefficient matrix (I-A)-1-I of IO table, i.e. water
use is assumed to be proportional to the intermediate demand coefficients
of all sectors to the water supply sector. The complete consumption
coefficient matrix used in this study is a domestic coefficient
matrix. We assumed that all visitor purchases are 100% domestically
produced. Our assumption is highly similar with the research of Sun and
Hsu (2019). This consideration arises because visitors’ preferences and
expenditures for imports are generally minimal. This paper assumes that
the impact of China’s imports on tourism can be ignored, because most
of the products consumed by tourists are produced domestically. However,
in some countries with large import volume, it is also possible that
tourists disproportionately consume goods that are imported from other
countries.
The original Chinese TSA (Tourism satellite account) data collected
from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People’s Republic of
China has 12 sectors (CTS, 2018). Since the Chinese Input-Output table
has only one “Road transport” sector, the original TSA data of motor
transport sector and local transport sector has been combined into the
“Road transport sector” of IO table in this paper. The matching of
original 12 Tourism Satellite Account sectors to 11 IO table sectors is
shown in Supplementary Table SI-1.
The direct tourism sector refers to the services that are directly
consumed by tourists such as travel, accommodation, catering, sightseeing,
shopping, entertainment and other services (UNWTO, 2008).
Lenzen et al. (2018) applied a similar approach to estimate the tourism
carbon footprint on the global scale. The 11 sectors from the TSA
expenditure data are quantified in the final demand vector Y, with other
sectors set to zero. These matched 11 direct tourism sectors are wholesale,
railway transport, road transport, water transport, air transport,
accommodation, food, telecommunications, culture, entertainment, and
other services.
By using the EEIO +TSA, the TWF in China can be divided in two
major parts; (1) the direct TWF derived from 11 direct tourism sectors
and (2) the indirect TWF derived from all 135 sectors of supply chain in
China. The direct TWF is a straightforward multiplication of the tourism
expenditure and the corresponding direct water use coefficients of 11
direct tourism sectors (Sun & Hsu, 2019).
DirectTWF=Dwc*Y (5)
where Dwc is direct water use coefficients vector of the 135 sectors (m3/
US $) and Y is the tourism expenditure (US $) vector.
The indirect TWF of domestic suppliers is calculated by inputting the
tourism expenditure (Y) into the EEIO model, where the interdependence
of sectors (the Leontief inverse matrix, (I-A)-1) is utilized to trace
the transactions of industries in the supply chain. The indirect TWF is
calculated as the total TWF minus the direct TWF in China (Sun & Hsu,
2019).
IndirectTWF=Dwc*(I-A)-1*Y− Dwc*Y (6)
The total TWF is calculated as the direct TWF add indirect TWF
which show in equation (7).
Total TWF= Direct TWF + Indirect TWF= Dwc*(I-A)-1*Y (7)
2.2.3. The impact of global water stress between Chinese and international
tourism
It is imperative to better understand the impact of water availability
from China’s TWF on different countries. The impact of the usage of the
same amount of water could vary from water-rich to water-scarce regions
(Feng et al., 2014). To take a region’s water availability into account,
water scarcity is calculated in using the water stress index, which
is commonly defined by the ratio of total annual freshwater withdrawals
to hydrological availability. The water stress index (WSI), ranging from
0 (no stress with no water withdrawals) to 1 (full use of available
renewable resources) or higher (using non-renewable resources), can be
calculated to represent the water scarcity for a local region (Pfister et al.,
2009). The smaller the WSI, the smaller the water stress. The WSI
concept has been routinely used in previous studies (Ridoutt and Pfister,
2010; Ridoutt and Pfister, 2013). Pfister et al. (2009) proposed to
multiply WF by the local WSI to assess the scarce WF of different regions.
3
L.-C. Lee et al.
In this study, to better understand the nexus between TWF flows and the
level of water scarcity globally, the calculated TWF and WSI are combined.
The net scarce TWF of China to other 77 countries can be
expressed by equation (8).
NetScarceTWFr = WSIr
* TWFc− r− WSIc
* TWFr− c (8)
where Net Scarce TWFr is the net value of the scarce TWF between
outbound Chinese tourist to country r and the outbound tourist of
country r to China. TWFc− r is the TWF caused by Chinese outbound
tourists to the destination country r, TWFr− c is the TWF caused by inbound
tourists to China from country r. WSIr is the WSI of country r.
WSIc is the WSI of China. The TWF of inbound tourists is calculated as
described above. The TWF of outbound tourists is not available and will
be estimated based on a simple assumption about the relationship between
local water footprints and inbound tourist water footprints (see
Section 3.2.4).
3. Results
3.1. The TWF of domestic and inbound tourism in China
The domestic and inbound tourism TWF of 2017 in China are presented
in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 (a) shows that the total domestic and inbound
TWF are 16,409 million m3 and 3,104 million m3
, respectively. The total
TWF of 19.51 billion m3 accounts for approximately 2.8% of the total
water consumption in China in 2017 (604 billion m3). The total domestic
TWF is around 5 times larger than that of the inbound TWF. For the
average daily TWF per domestic tourists, the direct TWF is 136 L/
tourist/day and the indirect TWF is 1,033 L/tourist/day. For the inbound
tourists, the direct TWF is 810 L/tourist/day and the indirect
TWF is 6,122 L/tourist/day (see Fig. 1(b)). Although the total inbound
TWF is much smaller than the total domestic TWF, the inbound tourists’
average daily TWF per tourist is around 6 times higher than that of the
domestic tourists. Within the IO analysis framework, this occurs because
inbound tourists have larger average daily expenditure and greater
consumption of more water-intense tourism activities than the domestic
tourists (Hadjikakou et al., 2015).
3.2. TWF of 135 sectors of China
3.2.1. Main direct and indirect tourism sectors
Among the 135 sectors, the three sectors with the largest total TWF
are agriculture (12,706 million m3), electricity (2,445 million m3), and
petroleum (254 million m3) (see Fig. 2). For the direct tourism sectors,
the accommodation sector has the highest total TWF of 1,153 million m3
Journal of Hydrology 603 (2021) 127151
among the 11 direct tourism sectors which accounts for 51% of total
direct water use. The second highest total TWF of 360 million m3 belongs
to air transport, followed by the sectors of wholesale, food, and
entertainment. For the indirect tourism sectors, agriculture, electricity
and petroleum are the top 3 total TWF sectors which account for 74%,
14% and 1% of all 124 indirect tourism sectors, respectively. The full
scope of each sector is given in Supplementary Table SI-2.
3.2.2. Structural analysis of direct and indirect TWF derived from direct
tourism sectors
To further analyze the impact of the 11 direct tourism sectors on
water resources, the structure of the direct (tourism activities) and indirect
TWF of the supply chain of each sector was investigated. We chose
three typical high TWF direct tourism sectors to do deeper analysis.
Fig. 3 (a) illustrates the direct and indirect TWF derived from the air
transportation sector. Air transportation generates the second-highest
total TWF (direct +indirect) among all the 11 direct tourism sectors
with a TWF of 3,763 million m3
, of which 9% is direct use, and 91% is
indirect use from the supply chain. Among the indirect TWFs, 56 %,
15%, 4%, and 1% are derived from the agriculture, electricity, petroleum,
and paper sectors, respectively. This means that the tourism activity
implemented by the air transportation sector not only generates a
TWF of 352 million m3 but also relies on water consumption by other
sectors.
The direct and indirect TWF derived from the accommodation sector
is revealed in Fig. 3 (b). The accommodation sector consists of 68%
indirect and 32% direct TWFs. Furthermore, similar to the structure
shown in Fig. 3 (a), the indirect TWF of the accommodation sector is
amplified by the sectors of agriculture and electricity in the supply
chain.
As shown in Fig. 3 (c), the food sector has the greatest indirect TWF
proportion among the 11 direct tourism sectors, i.e., 99% indirect and
only 1% direct. As might be expected, from the 6,340 million m3 of the
indirect TWF, almost 93% are contributed by the agriculture sector.
Details about the indirect TWF derived from all 11 direct tourism sectors
are shown in Supplementary Fig. SI-1. The direct TWF of all these 11
sectors ranges from 1% to 32% of the total TWF, which is much smaller
than the indirect TWF of these sectors. The summarization of tourist
expenditure, tourism output and TWF of 11 direct tourism sectors was
also investigated (Supplementary Table SI-3). Furthermore, from Supplementary
Table SI-3, the food sector (90 m3/m3) has the greatest indirect
TWF generation per unit of direct TWF used and the
accommodation sector has the lowest (2 m3/m3). This implies that the
relatively small amount of food consumption by tourists lead to large
indirect water use for the supply chain in China, though this may also be

affected by food imports (not addressed in this study). Conversely, the
total TWF of accommodation sector is more likely directly used by
tourists in the hotel or living place.
To further study the relationship between the direct and indirect
tourism sectors, the structure network of the total 11 direct tourism
sectors and their corresponding top 20 indirect TWF derived sectors is
shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the 11 direct tourism sectors, a total of 20
indirect tourism sectors are revealed in Fig. 4. The agriculture, chemical,
electricity, papermaking, petroleum, special chemical, and steel sectors
are found within the top 10 sectors in terms of the indirect TWF derived
from all 11 direct tourism sectors.
Overall, and as expected, it can be concluded that a vast amount of
virtual water is embodied in the agriculture, electricity, and petroleum
sectors for the tourism industry. From water conservation perspective,
indirect water use is likely more significant than direct use. Thus, it is
important to adopt effective water conservation measures to control the
water consumption of the three aforementioned indirect sectors to save
water resources. Specifically, improvements in water use efficiency in
the agriculture sector has an outsize effect on reduction of the TWF.
3.2.3. Comparison with other studies
For comparison purpose, Fig. 5 illustrates the accommodation TWF
per guest per day in different regions. The blue data are obtained from
Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA, 2015), and the red data are
calculated by our study. China’s domestic accommodation TWF has the
lowest value as compared to any other region. This is mainly because

PATA’s analysis used a bottom-up method, which focused on 4–5 star
level hotels, and our study used a top-down method which covers almost
all hotels. Moreover, China’s inbound accommodation TWF is close to
the data from regions such as the Caribbean, Middle East, South Asia,
and Southeast Asia.
We also compare with estimates of TWF per tourist per day provided
by previous studies. Some previous studies adopted the bottom-up
approach (G¨ ossling, 2015; G¨ ossling et al., 2012; Hsu and Sun, 2014;
Li, 2018; Yang et al., 2011), in which the TWF is obtained mainly by the
combination of on-site tourist surveys and the collection of data from
various literatures. In contrast, some other studies adopted the top-down
approach by using a combination of EEIO and TSA to calculate the TWF
(Cazcarro et al., 2014; Cazcarro et al., 2016; Hadjikakou et al., 2015;
Hsu and Sun, 2014; Sun and Hsu, 2019). For the bottom-up approach, a
limited number of sectors can be investigated, whereas more sectors can
be included in the calculation for the top-down approach. However, the
TWF per tourist per day obtained by the bottom-up approach ranged
from 2,000 to 12,000 L/tourist/day (G¨ ossling, 2015; G¨ ossling et al.,
2012; Li, 2018; Yang et al., 2011), which is significantly larger than that
of 200–5,000 L/tourist/day obtained by the top-down approach (Hadjikakou
et al., 2015) as well as that calculated in this study. Our result
estimates the average TWF of China in 2017 to be 1,354 L/tourist/day
((direct +indirect WF)/ (domestic +inbound tourist)). This difference
may be attributed to the fact that the tourist information collected
within the bottom-up approach is related to relatively “high-spending”
hotels. Because the hotels with high star level commonly construct an
6
L.-C. Lee et al.
organized management and standardized statistical water use data, it is
easier to collect data from these hotels. On the other hand, the low-
spending tourism spectrum was widely neglected because of the difficulty
of data collection. High-spending tourism services usually
consume more water resources than low-spending services (Cazcarro
et al., 2016).
Overall, the system boundaries, method, data sources and timeline of
previous and our paper are quite disparate for examining the TWF.
However, the main conclusions are similar with that of the previous
finding, i.e. food demand is the main driving sector for producing the
TWF and the inbound tourist creat higher TWF than domestic.

3.2.4. TWF flow between China and the rest of the world
China not only attracts millions of inbound tourists but also contributes
an enormous number of outbound tourists to other countries. To
examine the net TWF flows between inbound and outbound tourists, the
inbound and outbound TWF of 77 foreign tourism countries to and from
China are calculated. These 77 representative countries account for over
90% of global water consumption (WB, 2021). This calculation was
based on the study by Hoekstra and Mekonnen (Hoekstra and Mekonnen,
2012), who estimated the water footprints globally, from which the
local per capita water footprint of a destination country can be obtained.
Our calculation results indicate that the TWF of foreign tourists is
around 1.5 times larger than the living water consumption of local

residents in China. This result is basically consistent with the calculation
results of others (Hadjikakou et al., 2015; Li, 2018). Hence, we used the
1.5 times to multiply the local per capita water footprint from Cazcarro
et al. (2014) and then received an estimate of the inbound daily TWF per
Chinese tourist for each country. This assumption is made due to lack of
data about the footprint of Chinese tourists overseas. This assumption is
based on the water footprint of different countries, which reflect
regional differences to a certain extent. Furthermore, to calculate the net
water flow pattern of bilateral travel between China and other destinations,
the water footprint that is saved at home should technically be
considered, which would be expected to reduce water use in a tourist’s
country of origin. In this paper, the water footprint saving at home when
a tourist travels abroad is not included as the focus is on the water
footprint generated by the tourist rather than the net impact of tourism
on local water resources.
Our calculations indicate that China’s outbound tourists generate a
total TWF of 1,241 million m3 in the destination countries, whereas
inbound foreign tourists only generate a TWF of 334 million m3 in
China. Thus, China is a net tourism water consuming country with a net
TWF of 906 million m3 from the perspective of a global tourism water
resource (Supplementary Table SI-4). This suggests that Chinese tourists
consume more water in foreign countries than water is consumed by
foreign tourists in China.
A total of 56 countries have a positive net TWF, and 21 countries
have a negative net TWF. Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the top ten positive and
negative net TWF flows between China and the corresponding countries.
The countries indicated with red arrows have a positive net TWF flow,
which means that Chinese tourism causes a shift in water use from China
to these countries. The countries indicated with black arrows have a
negative net TWF flow, which means the net TWF flows from these
countries to China.
The top ten negative net TWF departure countries are mainly located
in West and South Asia (India, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Tajikistan,
Yemen), only a few countries are in Europe (UK, Ukraine, Belarus) and
Colombia. Among them, most of those west Asian countries have an
extreme water shortage, which is more serious than that of China. Most
of them are developing countries, and the number of inbound tourists
from those countries is much higher than the number of outbound
Chinese tourists to those countries.
The top ten positive net TWF flows to destination countries of Chinese
tourists are found in Asia (Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
South Korea), Europe (Italy, Spain, and France), the United States, and
Australia. Most of these countries are developed countries or East and
South East Asian countries close to China. These countries account for
77% of the sum of positive net TWF flows. Half of the top ten positive net
TWF destination countries has a much lower WSI than China (0.47),
such as Japan (0.32), Italy (0.27), Malaysia (0.04), France (0.18), and
Vietnam (0.35). The smaller the WSI, the smaller the water stress and
the richer the water resources. For these water-rich countries, the impact
on water resources from Chinese tourism may not be as important.
Overall, the water-rich countries (WSI < 0.35) account for 46% of the
sum of positive net TWF flows. In contrast, the water-poor countries
(WSI greater than 0.5) account for 54%. This is especially the case for
Thailand, South Korea, and Spain that are the main destinations of
Chinese tourists. The tourists from China may cause greater pressure on
the water resources of these countries
In order to further examine the relationship between water scarcity
and net TWF flows, the net scarce TWF flows is calculated using equation
(8) for 77 corresponding countries. The results are depicted in
Supplementary Table SI-4 and illustrated in Fig. 6 (b). A total of 38
countries have a positive net scarce TWF and 39 countries have a
negative net scarce TWF. The comparison of net TWF flows and net
scarce TWF flows shows that around 72% of countries have the same
flow direction. Only in Azerbaijan (WSI: 0.90) and Iran (WSI: 0.91)
changes from negative to positive. Both countries are extremely water
deficient areas. Furthermore, about 25% of countries (Malaysia,
Journal of Hydrology 603 (2021) 127151
Myanmar, Canada and some European counties, such as Russia, Germany,
Poland, Sweden, Denmark) change their flow direction from
positive to negative. These countries are water-rich countries. All these
countries have a very low WSI (smaller than 0.2). All estimates of the
impacts of China’s outbound tourist to the world are provided as TWF
per tourist per day in the Supplementary Table SI-4. In summary,
considering local water resources, the pressure of tourists from these
water rich countries such as Canada, Germany, Myanmar, Russia,
Sweden on China’s water resources is greater than that of Chinese
tourists on the water resources of these countries. Therefore, when
examining geographic changes in the water use derived from tourism, it
is imperative to consider not only the direct and indirect tourism water
use but also the geographical features of global water availability and
withdrawals.
4. Conclusions
This study investigated the TWF of China by using the EEIO top-
down method and TSA data. For the first time, all 135 (11 direct +
124 indirect) sectors related to tourism were considered. The average
TWF for all the tourists is 1,354 (L/tourist/day). Moreover, we combined
the WSI, which reflects the degree of local water scarcity in each
country, with a transfer of the WF based on a simple assumption about
ratio of domestic footprint to inbound tourist footprint to analyze the
impact of China’s tourism on the water resources of various countries.
Our study revealed the total domestic TWF is around seven times higher
than the total inbound TWF, while the average daily TWF per inbound
tourists is three times higher than that of domestic tourists. Moreover,
China’s indirect TWF is around ten times higher than its direct TWF. We
also found that the accommodation sector has the highest direct TWF
with 1061 million m3 among the 11 direct tourism sectors in China,
followed by the air transportation sector. Among the 124 indirect
tourism sectors, the agriculture sector has the highest indirect TWF
(12,706 million m3), followed by the petroleum and electricity sectors.
From the perspective of water use balance on Chinese tourist’s global
tourism activities, China is a net tourism water consuming country with
a net TWF (i.e., outbound TWF - inbound TWF) of 898 million m3
. The
major TWF flows has the transfer from China to Southeast Asia, Japan,
Western Europe, and the United States. Nearly half of the destination
countries of Chinese outbound tourists with a positive net TWF have a
water scarcity problem worse than mainland China, such as Thailand,
South Korea and Spain. When taking this scarcity of local water resources
into consideration, we found that the inbound TWF caused by
European, Canadian, and Malaysian tourists to China place more pressure
on Chinese water resources than the water consumption of Chinese
tourists on the water resources of those countries.
In the post epidemic era, on the one hand, the direct tourism water
footprint might be reduced. According to our calculated results, the
accommodation sectors have the highest total TWF among the 11 direct
tourism sectors and accounts for 51% of all direct water consumption.
Especially, the infrastructure of hotels and restaurants should be transformed,
advanced water-saving appliances and unconventional water
resources should be applied to reduce direct tourism water footprint. On
the other hand, indirect tourism water footprint should be noted. Given
that the agriculture, electricity, and petroleum sectors majorly
contribute to the indirect TWF, food and energy conservation is also
particularly important for reduction of water footprint. For indirect
water footprint, more reasonable and realistic measures for tourism
related enterprises include: (1) advocate food conservation; (2) install
advanced energy-saving equipment, and increase the use of solar energy
or green power; and (3) reduce the use of disposable goods. From a more
macro perspective, the green supply chain of tourism should be established
to improve the overall resource efficiency.
The findings of TWF flow between China and the rest of the world are
based on simple assumptions and could be made more accurate if the
water consumption data of Chinese tourists in destination countries can
8
L.-C. Lee et al.
be obtained. Moreover, due to data limitations, we lack more detailed
research on the characteristics of different agricultural sectors and
tourists. Future TWF estimations require the water use intensity of detail
agriculture sectors and tourist types to be stratified more specifically.
Another possible direction of future research in that regard involves
drawing on studies of water (consumption) based on an IO table or with
disaggregated Social Accounting Matrix in the agricultural sectors.
Disparities from water resources utilization mode of agricultural products
and individual tourist could result in different behavior and habits
and lead to various consumption pattern.

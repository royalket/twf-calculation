## 2. Tourism Demand  (TSA → NAS-scaled → EXIOBASE Y)

TSA 2015-16 extrapolated to 2019 and 2022 using NAS Statement 6.1 real GVA
growth (constant 2011-12 prices), multiplied by CPI deflator to get nominal
Rs crore consistent with the SUT data.

| Year | Nominal (Rs cr) | Nominal (USD M) | Real 2015-16 (Rs cr) | Real 2015-16 (USD M) | Non-zero EXIOBASE sectors | CAGR nominal vs 2015 | USD/INR Rate |

### 3.5 By sector type — where tourism demand lands

> **Interpretation note:** Agriculture shows 0 here because tourists do not
> purchase raw crops directly. Agricultural water is embedded inside the Food
> Manufacturing categories (34–50% of total) through Leontief supply-chain
> propagation. Section 3.6 shows where water physically *originates*.

| Sector Type | 2015 m³ | 2015 % | 2019 m³ | 2019 % | 2022 m³ | 2022 % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agriculture | 0 | 0.0% | 0 | 0.0% | 0 | 0.0% |
| Food Mfg | 2,951,221,231 | 46.0% | 2,717,433,638 | 41.6% | 2,927,073,315 | 56.8% |
| Manufacturing | 151,348,469 | 2.4% | 197,151,533 | 3.0% | 235,035,256 | 4.6% |
| Mining | 0 | 0.0% | 0 | 0.0% | 0 | 0.0% |

| Textiles | 290,186,580 | 4.5% | 377,973,379 | 5.8% | 338,792,463 | 6.6% |
| Utilities | 12,476,873 | 0.2% | 20,664,483 | 0.3% | 19,130,387 | 0.4% |


### 3.6 By source sector — where water physically originates

Structural decomposition: `pull[i,j] = W[i] × L[i,j] × Y[j]` summed over all
tourism-demand destinations j, then grouped by the *upstream* sector i.

**Use this table — not 3.5 — when citing agricultural water share in publications.**
Agriculture here accounts for the true upstream extraction (typically 60–80 % of
indirect TWF) that flows through supply chains before reaching Food Manufacturing.

Allocation method: total water split proportionally by tourist-days
(domestic share × total m³ / dom tourist-days, and similarly for inbound).

## 7. Sector Efficiency Trends  (2015 → 2022, indirect TWF)

### Most improved — indirect water fell most

| Rank | Category | 2015 m³ | 2022 m³ | Change % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hotels & Restaurants | 1,880,597,255 | 488,306,182 | -74.0% |

## 8. Type I Multiplier — EXIOBASE Data Artefacts

Products whose multiplier was positive in 2015 but became **exactly zero**
in 2022. These are **not** genuine efficiency gains — they are EXIOBASE
database revisions where the upstream water coefficient was set to zero.
A genuine improvement stays > 0 in both years.

| Product ID | Product Name | EXIOBASE Code(s) | 2015 m³/Rs cr | 2022 m³/Rs cr | Change % | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | - | - | - | none found |


To investigate: compare the code(s) above between
`IOT_2015_ixi/water/F.txt` and `IOT_2022_ixi/water/F.txt`.
If the zero reflects a data gap, impute using an adjacent year or sector average.

### Genuine top-5 improvements  (multiplier > 0 in both years)

| Product ID | Product Name | 2015 m³/Rs cr | 2022 m³/Rs cr | Change % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | - | - |


### Genuine top-5 deteriorations  (multiplier increased)

| Product ID | Product Name | 2015 m³/Rs cr | 2022 m³/Rs cr | Change % |

## 9. Sensitivity Analysis

### 9.1 Indirect TWF — ±20 % agricultural water coefficients

| Year | LOW (bn m³) | BASE (bn m³) | HIGH (bn m³) | Range ±% |

## 10. Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA)

Decomposes the change in indirect TWF between year-pairs into three drivers
using the two-polar decomposition method (eliminates residual term):

- **W effect** — change in water coefficients (technology / efficiency improvement)
- **L effect** — change in Leontief inverse (supply-chain structure / intermediation)
- **Y effect** — change in tourism demand (volume growth + composition shift)

`ΔTWF = W_effect + L_effect + Y_effect`  (residual < 0.01% confirms decomposition identity)

### 10.1 Decomposition by period

| Period | TWF Start (bn m³) | TWF End (bn m³) | ΔTWF (bn m³) | W Effect (bn m³) | W % | L Effect (bn m³) | L % | Y Effect (bn m³) | Y % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2015→2019 | 47.8547 | 76.7864 | +28.9318 | +2.1627 | +7.5% | -1.2858 | -4.4% | +28.0318 | +96.9% |
| 2019→2022 | 76.7864 | 75.5942 | -1.1923 | -3.7183 | -311.9% | -0.7867 | -66.0% | +3.3236 | +278.8% |


### 10.2 Interpretation

- A **negative W effect** means water technology improved (less water per unit output).
- A **negative L effect** means supply chains became less water-intensive.
- A **positive Y effect** means tourism demand growth added water pressure.

If Y effect dominates, policy priority is demand-side management (tourist volumes, product mix).
If W effect is small or positive, efficiency interventions in upstream sectors are needed.

## 13. Key Findings

- Total TWF decreased 13.5% from 2015 to 2022 (6.9425 → 6.0076 billion m3).
- Indirect water averaged 89% of total TWF across study years.
- Water intensity (indirect) fell from 6,912 to 3,439 m3/Rs crore (-50.2%), reflecting supply-chain efficiency and structural demand shifts.
- Hotel direct water intensity fell from 1,251.0 to 818.0 L/room/night (-34.6%, CHSB India data).
- COVID-19 impact visible: 2022 direct TWF lower than 2019 (reduced hotel occupancy, fewer flights).

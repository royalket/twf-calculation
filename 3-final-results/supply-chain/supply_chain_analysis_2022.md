## 1. Dominant Supply-Chain Pathways

Each row is a source→destination pair in the IO table.
`Source` is where water is physically extracted;
`Destination` is where tourism demand activates that chain.

## 2. Hypothetical Extraction Method (HEM)

Tourism dependency index = sector's tourism-driven output requirement
as a share of total tourism-driven output across all sectors.
Higher = more dependent on tourism demand.

## 3. Interpretation Notes

- **Agriculture dominates** the source-sector view because paddy rice, wheat,
  and other crops have water coefficients orders of magnitude larger than
  manufacturing or services sectors.

- **The demand-destination view** (reported in Section 3.5 of the main report)
  shows Agriculture = 0% because no tourism rupee flows *directly* to raw crops.
  Agricultural water is embedded inside Food Manufacturing through Leontief
  supply-chain propagation.

- **Policy implication**: Efficiency interventions in agricultural irrigation
  (drip irrigation, direct-seeded rice) have far greater leverage on total
  tourism water footprint than hotel water recycling programmes.

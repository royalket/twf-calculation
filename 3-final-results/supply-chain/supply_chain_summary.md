## Key Interpretation

- Agriculture consistently dominates the **source-sector** view (typically 60-80%),
  confirming that India's tourism water footprint is primarily an agricultural
  water management challenge, not a hospitality sector challenge.

- The COVID-19 impact (2022) is visible in reduced Services pathway shares
  (less hotel, transport activity) and relatively higher Agricultural shares
  (food supply chains remained active).

- The HEM dependency index (per-year files) shows which upstream sectors
  would be most affected by a hypothetical collapse of tourism demand.
